All information collected can be used for Intel purposes. It support PE 32bits and 64bits for executables files type EXE, DLL, SYS, SCR, CPL, MSI, COM and at the moment just work in *NIX-Based distros.

This tool should always be accompanied by the file "packerdb.txt" to work. If you try to get information from a file that is not MZ and/or don't use the mentioned file together with the tool, you will see the following message in red color: "It isn't a PE file or missing file packerdb.txt.

* Requires:
First, remember run the following commands:
 apt-get update 
 apt-get upgrade
 apt-get install python-pip

Then just run "requirements.txt" file using the command pip install -r requirements.txt

But if you prefer to install the packages separately, follow the instructions for each case:

* PEfile: https://github.com/erocarrera/pefile 
 apt-get install python-pefile 

* Magic: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-magic
 pip install python-magic

* SSDeep: http://ssdeep.sourceforge.net
 pip install ssdeep

* FuzzyHashLib: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fuzzyhashlib
 pip install fuzzyhashlib

This package is required for get SDHash data, but if you have any problem with package install process, can install SDHash separately:
    * SDHash: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sdhash
      pip install sdhash
        
Maybe you need install requires distributions for SDHash separately. Please use following commands:
  pip install NumPy or visit https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy
  pip install SciPy or visit https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scipy
  pip install Pillow

***** By default, SDHash option is disabled because the string is too long. If you want to know this data, please uncomment the line 83, or line "print Fore.WHITE + Style.NORMAL + "SDHash: %s" % Style.DIM + fuzzyhashlib.sdhash(data).hexdigest()" and save change.

***** Fuzzy-Hash Algorithms just show data, this process don't compare files. 
 
* Bitstring: https://github.com/scott-griffiths/bitstring
